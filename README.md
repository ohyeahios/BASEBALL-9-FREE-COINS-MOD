How to Obtain Coins:
Coins are awarded after every game, with larger rewards for victories and league progression. Random bonuses can also be earned after matches, and coins may be given as part of daily rewards or event participation. The amount earned increases as you advance through higher leagues, making consistent play the best way to accumulate coins.

Uses of Coins:
Coins are versatile and can be used for a wide range of purposes, including:

Upgrading player stats and potential

Purchasing standard gear and accessories (bats, gloves, guards, glasses)

Customizing player appearance, such as changing batting or throwing hand, or altering player motions

Buying certain stadiums and facilities

While coin-purchased accessories and upgrades are effective, their stat boosts are generally lower than those bought with gems. For example, a coin accessory might provide +2 to a stat, while a gem accessory could offer +5.

Strategic Tips:
Early in the game, coins may seem abundant, but as your team develops, the cost of upgrades and gear increases significantly. Prioritize spending coins on essential upgrades and filling gaps in your roster before investing in cosmetic changes or less impactful items.

Tickets

Tickets, particularly recruitment tickets, are a special resource used to acquire new players for your roster. They are closely tied to gems but have their own strategic importance.

How to Obtain Tickets:
Recruitment tickets are primarily purchased with gems—each ticket usually costs 150 gems. Occasionally, tickets may be awarded as event rewards or through special promotions, but this is less common.

Uses of Tickets:
Recruitment tickets allow you to add new players to your team. Only recruited players can be upgraded, making these tickets essential for building a competitive lineup. Non-recruited players have fixed stats and cannot be improved, putting you at a disadvantage against stronger teams.

Strategic Tips:
Focus your early gem spending on recruitment tickets to ensure your team is composed of upgradable players. This will give you flexibility in player development and a better chance of succeeding in higher leagues.

Cards

While not as prominently featured as gems, coins, or tickets, cards in BASEBALL 9 typically refer to player cards or consumable items that provide temporary boosts or special abilities.

How to Obtain Cards:
Cards can be obtained through gameplay rewards, event participation, or as part of certain in-game purchases. The specifics may vary depending on ongoing events or updates.



Cards are another critical resource, primarily used for player upgrades and evolutions. Player Cards are obtained through recruitment, events, or as match rewards, and duplicates can be used to enhance a player’s stats or evolve them into higher rarity tiers. Equipment Cards, on the other hand, provide stat boosts when equipped to players and can be upgraded using duplicates or other materials. Managing Cards efficiently is vital—players should focus on upgrading their core team members first and avoid wasting resources on lower-tier players who may not be useful in the long run.

Balancing the acquisition and use of these resources is crucial for success in BASEBALL 9. Players should prioritize earning Gems through events and achievements, spend Coins wisely on necessary upgrades, and use Tickets at optimal times to maximize their benefits. Cards should be strategically collected and invested in to strengthen the team over time. By understanding the role of each resource and managing them effectively, players can build a dominant team and enjoy sustained success in the game.
